3D models for gel electrophoresis equipment

The usual caveats apply to stuff you find online -- these files are for testing purposes only and were created for my edification. If you find them useful, great! Let me know :)

Agarose Gel Comb - put in your own dimensions and options to create a customised comb. Match an existing comb's dimensions to create one that will fit existing equipment

Agarose Gel Casting Tray - put in gel-tray and comb dimensions to create a customised casting tray which will accept your custom comb. You can probably 3D-print this but it's probably cheaper (and more robust, depending on your print material!) to order in some custom-cut polycarbonate or acrylic sheets and glue them together yourself.

Coming soon (maybe?) - a casting tray clamp/holder (for casting gels)
